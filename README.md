# US Bike Share Data
## Project: 
To create an interactive platform to generate basic stats from US Bike share data

## Dataset:

The dataset is provided by Udacity under the course Data Analyst NanoDegree Program. Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.  Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.  In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.  
The Datasets Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:  
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) 
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) 
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776) 
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway &amp; Barry Ave) 
- End Station (e.g. Sedgwick St &amp; North Ave) 
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer).

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:  
- Gender 
- Birth Year

## Learning:
- Pandas DataFrame Manipulations
- Basic Pythonic Scripting
- Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.
- Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.
- Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.
